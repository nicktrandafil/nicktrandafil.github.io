Hi, I'm Nicolai. Welcome to my website, where I post my work.

A group of loafers basked in a meadow. A whimsical old man, who happened to dislike lazy people, was passing nearby. The scene distressed him; he brandished an incendiary gun. The loafers reeled in fear. One of them assumed they were getting mugged. The man zapped the loafers. The judge was impartial but also lazy, as he never got around to charging the whimsical man for the crime. The whimsical man was baffled whether to like or dislike lazy people.
